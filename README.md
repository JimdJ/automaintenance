# automaintenance
A simple application for tracking automobile maintenance tasks. I wrote this application with the intention of demonstrating how to access a MySQL database in Java, and displaying/updating its contents in a GUI (JTable).

So I thought I should add a little about myself. I drink coffee and I have a pug named Amos.
